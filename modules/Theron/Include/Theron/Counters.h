\brief Enumerated type that lists event counters available for querying.

The counters measure threadpool activity levels, so are useful for
managing the size of the internal thread-pools within \ref Framework "frameworks".
    
All counters are local to each Framework instance, and count events in
the queried Framework only.

\note The counters are only incremented if the value of the \ref THERON_ENABLE_COUNTERS
define is non-zero. If THERON_ENABLE_COUNTERS is zero then the values of the counters
will always be zero.

\see Framework::GetCounterValue
